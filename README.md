# Save the lambda


This plans to be a very small CYOA game in a Single Page Application with a RPG flavour to it (since it has a map and you can move around).

Your mission is to save the lost lambda (```[](){}```) from the hands of the evil whatever.

This game heavily inspired and started by following the tutorial in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqpPgK13oEM&t=0s) and [this series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGngRMfDz1o).

You can play it [here](https://sousajf1.github.io/save-the-lambda/) :) .


## Development:

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start:dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view it in the browser.

(The "real" main function is inside ``src/components/app/index.js``)


## Deploy:

In order to deploy it to gh-pages, you can run:

### `npm run deploy`

Beware to change the `homepage` value on the `package.json`.
