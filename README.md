# Save the lambda


This plans to be a very small CYOA game in a Single Page Application with a RPG flavour to it (since it has a map and you can move around).

Your mission is to save the lost lambda (```[](){}```) from the hands of the evil whatever.

This game heavily inspired and started by following the tutorial in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqpPgK13oEM&t=0s).

You can play it [here](https://sousajf1.github.io/save-the-lambda/) :) .
